RESTFUL-WS 
==========



Collection of RESTful web service implementation for core DASH functions. The source code is developed as Eclipse Maven project using facets "Dynamic Web Project" and "Java". The code has been tested for a default JRE Java 1.7 The following assumptions have been made:

1. Java backend provides a RESTful web service.  
2. AngularJS consumes the web service.

We used a [tutorial](http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/tutorial-rest-api-design-and-implementation-in-java-with-jersey-and-spring/) as guideline for the overall implementation.
